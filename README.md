## 👋 Hi, I'm Monika Ratan

Professional Blogger and Co-Editor at https://superdevresources.com. I like graphic design, digital art and writing.

I worked as Associalte Consultant at IBM and Capgemini from 2008-2013. I left my full-time job in 2013, to pursue my own dreams of making digital products.

I have a B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from BIT, Sindri.

When not working, I usually like to play word games or watch sci-fi movies and series.
