I also made mobile apps for Windows Phone (2012-2014) which saw more than 3 million downloads worldwide. [View Apps](https://kunruchcreations.com/apps/).

I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Microsoft from 2007-2013 in core development team of Microsoft Office (Excel and OneNote) for Windows Phone. I left my full-time job as a Software Development Engineer at Microsoft in 2013, to pursue my own dreams of making and self-publishing apps & digital products.

I have a B.Tech. in Information and Communications Technology from DAIICT, Gandhinagar.

When I am not working, I usually like to play real-time strategy games or watch documentaries on Universe, origin of life and E.T.
